<h1>Need for Rodent Control</h1>

<p>The Emergency Conservation Work Program has been of inestimable value
in the control of prairie dogs, ground squirrels, pocket gophers, kangaroo
rats, rabbits, and porcupines. The citizens of the West have been forced to
carry on campaigns for the control of these rodents since the settlers first
staked out claims on the prairies. To the agricultural interests of the West
the control of rodents is as vital as is the proper spraying of trees throughout
the East to prevent damage by insects. These small mammals cover the western
ranges by countless thousands, and control is necessary if crops are to be
grown.</p>

<p>Rodent control is nothing new. Records indicate that as early as 1808,
strychnine was shipped by boat around Cape Horn to the Santa Barbara Mission,
Calif., in order that the early settlers might kill off the ground squirrels.
A constant fight has been waged ever, since, but unfortunately, while the landowners
were willing to finance the killing of squirrels on their own holdings,
the Federal Government provided inadequate funds to take care of the vast areas
of public domain, national forests, Indian reservations, and other Federal holdings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-&#8239;2&#8239;-</a></span></p>


<h2>Federal, State, and Local Cooperation</h2>

<p>When the Emergency Conservation Work Program came into being, the Forest
Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Division
of Grazing, and the Bureau of Biological Survey took the opportunity to treat
a vast acreage that would have been treated years ago had funds permitted.
During the three fiscal years 1934 to 1936 a total of almost 20,000,000 acres
had been covered by E.C.W. for the control of these various rodent pests. On the
statute books of several Western States rodent-control laws provide that landowners
may establish rodent-control districts wherein all lands are treated
simultaneously by paid crews working under the supervision of the Biological
Survey. Never before the E.C.W. program were there adequate Federal funds to
make these laws effective by taking proper care of infested public lands adjacent
to private holdings.</p>

<p>The most concrete proof of the necessity of rodent control is found in
the amount of money expended by private individuals throughout the West for
this purpose. The Federal Government, while owning as much as 60 percent of
the land in many of the Western States, contributes only about 25 percent of
the total cost of rodent-control operations. During the fiscal year 1936,
States, counties, and private individuals expended $665,785 for the purpose, while
the Biological Survey was able to expend only $226,623 from regular appropriations.
The E.C.W. program afforded the first opportunity of somewhere near
meeting the Federal Government's obligations to the citizens of the West in the
matter of adequately controlling the rodent pests that breed and range on public
lands and from these strongholds infest and reinfest adjacent private holdings.</p>


<h2>Training of E.C.W. Crews</h2>

<p>Rodent control is one of the most popular projects with E.C.W. enrollees
themselves as well as with the local people benefited. In many cases, crew
foremen supplied by the Survey took boys who would not work satisfactorily on
any other type of project and made real hands of them on rodent-control crews.
The boys liked to work in these crews, as it afforded them opportunity to become
acquainted not only with methods of rodent control but with the various
habits of wildlife as well.</p>

<p>In order to employ proper methods and place all possible safeguards
around poisoning operations for the protection of beneficial and harmless species,
the Biological Survey has insisted upon approving the appointments of all
men employed on the supervision of rodent-control work for its various cooperating
agencies. This is for the reason that when poisoning campaigns are properly
handled and carefully supervised, there is little danger of the accidental poisoning
of other animals. The records indicate that there have been practically no
cases of destruction of other forms of life through the E.C.W. rodent-control
program. Naturally, the supervisors not only must know rodent control but also
must be acquainted with the habits and status of wildlife in general, and in handling
the crews they have imparted knowledge to the beys that will be of permanent
benefit to them and to the Nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-&#8239;3&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>Educational programs were provided as regularly as possible, in order
to tell the C.C.C. enrollees of various wildlife problems. The entire personnel
of E.C.W. camps were shown films depicting the work of beavers, showing measures
for the protection of elk, deer, and other big-game animals, and portraying the
need of sane, sensible conservation methods, in order that the remnants of our
fast-vanishing forms of valuable wildlife might be preserved. Mimeographed
leaflets on wildlife management studies were made up by district agents of the
Survey for the boys in order that they might be given as broad instructions as
possible in the protection and preservation of species that are an asset rather
than a liability to man's interest. It has been the attempt of the Biological
Survey to make the rodent-control project a field laboratory for the education
of the enrollees in natural history and wildlife management, and the popularity
of the project among the boys attests to the wisdom of this course. In many
camps more applications for places on rodent-control crews were received than
there were places to fill.</p>


<h2>Timeliness of Emergency Aid</h2>

<p>Fortunately, the E.C.W. program came at the most opportune time. The
extreme drought throughout the west had forced rodents from the open lands into
adjacent irrigated valleys and mountain meadows, where they became especially
objectionable in their competition with livestock for the available forage.
Livestock and rodents together, during dry periods, have in many places almost
entirely denuded the surface soil of its vegetation. This has caused the beginning
of sheet erosion in areas where there would still be ample forage for livestock
had it not been for the excessive numbers of rodents. On many areas,
grazing by livestock and rodents combined has practically eliminated the native
grasses, and these are now being replaced with weeds and poisonous plants.
Damage in some instances has amounted to at least 75 percent of the available
forage, and the average loss has probably been approximately 25 percent.</p>

<p>On some of the Indian reservations of the Southwest, the condition has
been pitiful. On the Navajo Reservation, in particular, the Indians have carried
on a losing fight against drought and rodents. It has often been necessary
for them to replant their corn three and four times a season, since kangaroo rats
and other native rodents dig up the kernels as rapidly as they are planted.
Prior to the spring of 1936, there had been four years of drought, and this,
coupled with rodent damage, had reduced corn production to the point where the
Indians had barely enough for the spring seeding. All were clamoring for aid,
and in order to save their last crop of corn it was necessary to detail a foreman
with four or five E.C.W. Indians to go from farm to farm and conduct rodent-control
operations.</p>


<h2>Forest and Forage Protection</h2>

<p>The Forest Service is endeavoring to carry on a reforestation program
throughout much of the cut-over area in the Lake States and the Pacific Northwest.
One of the chief problems to successful reforestation is the control of
rodents, particularly the snowshoe hare. In the Olympic Forest in Washington,
the snowshoe hare has destroyed as much as 40 percent and damaged 70 percent
of the Douglas fir seedlings. In Michigan and Wisconsin, it was necessary to
carry on extensive rodent-control operations to permit the seedlings to survive.
Much of this work would never have been possible but for E.C.W. help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-&#8239;4&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<p>In the open area, jack rabbits have become a serious pest. The Biological
Survey, in 1934, received a petition bearing the signatures of more than 8,000
individuals of eastern Colorado, requesting Government aid in killing jack rabbits,
which were ravaging the meager stocks of forage left after drought and
wind had taken their toll.</p>

<p>The Forest Service recognized that rodent control would be essential
if the Plains Shelterbelt program of planting trees from the Canadian border
to Texas was to be effective, and in 1935 approximately one-tenth of its entire
appropriation for the program was expended for rodent control under the supervision
of the Biological Survey. Crews patrolled the planted areas constantly
to prevent the gnawing of the seedlings by jack rabbits and pocket gophers.</p>


<h2>Aid in Erosion Control</h2>

<p>The permanent benefits accruing from the E.C.W. rodent-control program
have been enormous from the standpoint of erosion control alone. An associate
range examiner of the Forest Service has the following to say regarding the
effect of rodents on erosion in the Boise watershed of Idaho:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Rodents, numerous and spreading over nearly 80 percent of the Boise
watershed, have undoubtedly been responsible for no small part of the present
erosion. Wholly dependent upon the herbaceous plants for their food supply,
their tremendous numbers, along with over-grazing by livestock and unfavorable
climate, have been an important contributing factor in depleting this cover,
and thus have greatly reduced the protection afforded the soil and subjected
it the more to increased sheet erosion. Even light rains on rodent-infested
areas are likely to start cutting, which may develop into destructive gully
erosion because of the almost immediate accumulation of run-offs in the myriads
of burrows and channels which these animals construct just under the surface
of the soil."</p></div>

<p>The control of rodents is vital to the successful operation of reclamation
projects in the western third of the United States. Rodents, particularly
pocket gophers, find the banks of irrigation canals an ideal location for
their burrows and runways. These subterranean passageways frequently are the
cause of serious breaks in canals, through which the flow of irrigation water
is diverted and wasted to flood adjacent lands, destroying valuable crops,
and indirectly ruining others by causing delays in delivery of water. Through
the E.C.W. program, C.C.C. crews working under the direction of experienced
foremen trained by the Biological Survey have greatly reduced this menace.
In the past year alone half a million acres of canal banks and contiguous lands
were treated by C.C.C. rodent-control crews with a thoroughness that will be
of lasting benefit to the nation's reclamation projects.</p>


<h2>Examples of Benefits Derived</h2>

<p>A few concrete examples will illustrate the great good that has resulted
from the E.C.W. rodent-control program. A group of farmers living at Springfield,
Idaho, suggested to the camp superintendent there that the jack rabbit
control work done by the E.C.W. crew during the summer of 1935 might pay the
cost of the camp. It is estimated that not less than 600,000 rabbits were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-&#8239;5&#8239;-</a></span>
killed by this crew on public lands adjacent to farming areas between American
Falls and Moreland, Idaho. The work afforded protection to not less than half
a million dollars worth of cultivated crops and to more than 75,000 acres of
grazing lands.</p>

<p>The control work carried on by an E.C.W. crew near Weber Lake, Calif.,
in 1933 has been responsible for a 50 percent comeback of the grass on a
large mountain meadow, which had been made a dust heap because of pocket gopher
workings. The pocket gophers had honeycombed the surface of the ground,
and sheep had trampled out most of the grass, while livestock grazing had been
reduced to a negligible figure. The restoration in two years was due primarily
to the elimination of the pocket gophers.</p>

<p>To control prairie dogs in Oklahoma, an area, of 47,000 acres in Pawnee,
Noble, and Kay Counties was treated through the medium of the E.C.W. The
Indian lands here are interspersed with private lands, and the landowners were
unable to make any progress in a general clean up because there were insufficient
Federal funds to treat the Indian lands until the E.C.W. project afforded
opportunity to carry on a systematic campaign over the entire area. A good
piece of work was accomplished, and this, in conjunction with water developments,
made the grass so much better over these old prairie dog towns in the
spring of 1935 that the Indian Service officials at Pawnee received an increased
rental of 25 cents an acre on their grazing lands. On areas where they received
50 cents an acre in 1934, they received 75 cents in 1935, a direct increase in
receipts to the Federal Treasury.</p>

<p>The permanent benefit accruing to the Indians from E.C.W. rodent control
is summed up as follows by an Agricultural Extension agent of the Indian
Service, at Anadarko, Oklahoma:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No little stress can be placed upon the financial value of the rodent-control
project to the Indians. The Indian enrollees received the labor benefit
on both Indian and deeded land throughout the reservation but still greater
than the temporary labor relief, the Indian has received a lasting increase in
the financial rental of his land. Due to such heavy prairie dog infestation
of the allotted land it had become necessary to reduce the rental value of the
grass land infested. Now that the prairie dogs have been controlled the rental
value will be increased by approximately 10 cents or more per acre because the
pastures will regrass and the carrying capacity will be increased. In comparing
this increase in rental value with the cost of controlling the prairie dogs,
the Indians will reap the financial benefit of the Government expenditures
in two or three years. Therefore, this project has certainly been of utmost
value to the reservation and the Extension Division in helping the Indian to
help himself."</p></div>


<h2>Safeguarding Harmless Species</h2>

<p>Some persons uninformed as to the need for rodent control and the methods
followed by the Biological Survey in carrying on the work have stated that
control by use of poison and C.C.C. workers endangers the existence of other
forms of wildlife. This, however, is not the case. The Biological Survey has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-&#8239;6&#8239;-</a></span>
studied rodent-control methods for more than twenty years and in this period
it has developed the most scientific and selective poisons possible. Scientific
investigations conducted by the Bureau are bringing increasing knowledge
of the habits of economically injurious species and of their physiological
reaction to various baits. This has made it possible to use more and more
specific control methods and so to select, prepare, and expose poison baits
as not seriously to endanger animals other than those for which the baits are
intended. When these scientific methods are carried out under direct supervision
of trained personnel, the total number of beneficial species destroyed
is negligible.</p>

<p>The Biological Survey is a conservation organization and will undertake
no work that will be detrimental to any species of animal not interfering too
greatly with the interests of man. Those conversant with actual conditions
in the range States realize that if agriculture is to survive, the control of
injurious rodents is as essential as is control of the corn borer, the chinch
bug, the boll weevil, the grasshopper, the coddling moth, and numerous other
agricultural pests. The Survey insists that in conducting work of this sort,
the most careful supervision by trained technicians must be given. All cooperating
agencies recognize the necessity for such supervision, and as a result
a most worth-while program has been carried on during the past three fiscal
years. The Biological Survey has entered into written cooperative understandings
with the various governmental agencies under which rodent-control activities
have been conducted. These agreements place the responsibility for
technically supervising all rodent-control activities in the hands of the
Bureau, leaving the cooperating agencies responsible for administration.</p>


<h2>Control Work Illustrated</h2>

<p>The illustrations on the following pages tell better than would volumes
of written words, the story of rodent damage and of cooperative work to reduce
this damage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-&#8239;7&#8239;-</a></span></p>

<h3>PRAIRIE DOGS</h3>

<p>Four years experimental study in
northern Arizona showed that prairie dogs
destroy 60 percent of the wheat grass, 99
percent of the dropseed, and 83 percent of
the grama grass, or 80 percent of the
total potential annual production of forage.
The possible destruction of four-fifths of
the forage, or even a far smaller proportion,
is serious enough at any time, but in periods
of drought it is likely to be calamitous.</p>

<h3>PORCUPINES</h3>

<p>On many national forest areas the control
of porcupines is imperative from the standpoint of
timber reproduction. This is especially true on
cut-over areas and where fires have destroyed all
seedlings. Porcupines will often destroy up to 90
percent of the seedlings and, through continued
girdling of young trees 15 to 25 years of age, will
destroy all chance for commercial timber for many
years to come.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
